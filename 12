# Introduction

R Markdown is a powerful tool for combining text, code, and output in a single document. 
It allows you to write narrative content, include calculations, and generate plots without switching between multiple files. 
This makes reports reproducible, shareable, and dynamic.

# Narrative Paragraph

One of the things I enjoy about R Markdown is that it blends prose and computation seamlessly. 
For example, I can explain an analysis and immediately show the code that performs it. 
This makes it ideal for tutorials, research reports, and project documentation.

# Math in R Markdown

You can include **inline math** like this: $\alpha + \beta = \gamma$, or a **displayed equation**:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

R Markdown uses LaTeX syntax for mathematical expressions, which renders beautifully in the final document.
